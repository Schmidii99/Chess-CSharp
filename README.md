## About the project

This is a full functional chess game that I built with WinForms. Everything is drawed and redrawed if neccessary and all figure position are stored in memory. 

This is an example of a started game, where white begins.

If clicked on a figure the game shows all possible moves, including all possible captures.

Once one king is captured the game is over and a messagebox appears with checkmate.

## Customization

The grid is resizable to any possible size. The actual pixel size is adjusted accordingly.
For example a 32 by 32 tile grid.

![32x32](images/32x32.PNG?raw=true "32x32 grid")

All possible moves are still calculated accurately.
